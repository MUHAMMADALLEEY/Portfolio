    shortDescription:
      "Implemented the Switchboard Customer Onboarding Widget, an embeddable script that lets users connect systems like Shopify, Amazon, NetSuite, Odoo and more without using the main Switchboard app. The widget automatically creates the organisation, sets up accounts, configures operations and builds the full connection workflow, allowing users to complete integrations quickly with no manual setup.",
    longDescription:
      "The Switchboard Customer Onboarding Widget is a fully embeddable tool that allows users to connect their systems to Switchboard without signing into the main platform. Before this widget, users had to manually create organisations, configure accounts, set up operations and navigate multiple steps inside the Switchboard dashboard, which made onboarding slow and technical. With the widget, users simply paste a script into any website or frontend app, instantly gaining access to a guided integration flow. The widget displays all supported systems such as Shopify, Amazon SP, NetSuite, Odoo, Cin7, Unleashed, Magento, WooCommerce and Finale Inventory, allowing users to choose the platform they want to connect. Each system launches its own onboarding modal, whether it is an Odoo credentials form or a Shopify OAuth flow, ensuring a simple experience for every connector. The widget automatically creates the organisation inside Switchboard, sets up both source and destination accounts and configures the required workflows such as syncing inventory, syncing orders and loading products. It then establishes the full connection between systems without requiring users to navigate the main Switchboard interface. This approach removes technical setup, speeds up onboarding, reduces support overhead and enables partners to offer Switchboard integrations directly on their websites. In simple terms, the widget turns a multi step configuration process into an automated end to end workflow, allowing users to integrate their systems by selecting a platform and entering basic details.",
